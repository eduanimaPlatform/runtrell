# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fix same-generation lease heartbeats aborting checkpoint saves with `Conflict`
  in MemoryStore and PgStore. `RunStore::renew` now extends only the owner's
  lease without advancing `RunRecord::revision`. Observe renewal via the returned
  `Claim` and persisted `owner.lease_until`, not a revision increment. Checkpoint
  CAS, ownership/generation/expiry fences, cancellation and deadlines still apply.

- Fix OpenAI Responses and chat completions (including OpenRouter) rejecting
  logical tool names such as `files.list`. Definitions and historical calls now
  use deterministic names within the provider's 64-character ASCII constraint;
  returned calls restore the original logical names. Distinct names that collide
  produce a configuration error before sending. Gemini names remain unchanged.
